## Easy to use

Say comes with a keyboard shortcut configured to help you to read selected text more easilly. Simply select a text with your mouse, press \<Super\>+Escape ans **say** will read it!

A configuration panel is added to your **system preferences** section so you can define the default language, volume and speed that **say** will use.

## Give it a try!

### First of all

If you never used a *Makefile* before, there is a chance that you don't have the required package to process it. To solve this problem, simply open a terminal and type:

`sudo apt-get install build-essential`

### Install the program

Through a terminal, go to the say folder and type:

`make install`

This command will create a debian package and install it in your system.

**You're ready to go!**
